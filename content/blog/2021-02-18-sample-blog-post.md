Hello world…again is what I should be saying. After a failed purely JavaScript blog trial, I have gone back to the original idea of just using WordPress

As you may have gathered from the page description, I am currently learning cyber security through the Open University. I have started my first module TM111 and have nearly completed the first block of it. Really, I should be studying now rather than writing this post but alas here we are.

I have some plans over the next few months to work through some challenge on either [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) or [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), although I think I need to learn a bit more before I do that.

Right, I should go back to actually studying now, speak to you all soon.
