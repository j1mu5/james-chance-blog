So, with the new year arriving I decided that I needed to get back to blogging on a regular basis. Part of my degree is to write action plans for goals. Blogging regularly is definitely one of those goals for me so with a bit of luck I will be posting more content soon.

### University

I have just got back into the swing of things after taken the Christmas period off. I have got to the stage that I will be able to had in my second TMA for TM111 with the next week or so. At the end of January, I will be starting my Maths module MU123 which means that February will be a very busy month as TM111 doesn't end until the beginning of March.

### Try Hack Me

I started the Advent of Cyber 2 in the middle of December so I am looking to finish this off soon. I am intending to start another path then, odds on it will be the web hacking fundamentals.



### Reading

I have been reading a lot more recently and over the Christmas holidays I got the chance to read Joe Marler's Loosehead autobiography which is definitely worth a read. I am now reading Web Hacking 101: How to Make Money Hacking Ethically by Peter Yaworski to gain a bit on insight into how bug bounty hunters find vulnerabilities.

Well, that's basically it for this month, I'll speak to you all in February.
